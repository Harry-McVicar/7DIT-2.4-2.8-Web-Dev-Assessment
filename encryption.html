      <h1>Encryption</h1>
      <p>Encryption is the process by which data, also known as plaintext, is converted into unreadable ciphertext so that it is protected from potentially being intercepted by hackers. This is achieved through the use of a key which encrypts and decrypts data, preventing it from being intercepted inbetween the sender and the reciever.</p>

      <h1>What is encyption and why is it so important?</h1>
      <p>Encryption is important as it prevents private data from being accessible to hackers, who could potentially use your personal details to blackmail or target you with phishing schemes. Some encryption methods are more breakable than others, such as caesar cipher, but the algorithms used in modern society are typically very sturdy. The public-private key method which is primarily used today is extremely hard to break, but not impossible.</p>

      <h1>The key distribution problem</h1>
      <p>The fundamental issue of the key distribution problem is that, while the ciphertext can be sent safely across an unsecure network, the key cannot. Single key encryption, also known as symmetric encryption, uses the same key to encrypt the message as it uses to decrypt the message. This means that the user and the sender must each know the key in order to send and read one another’s messages. Their data cannot be intercepted by hackers as only they know the secret key. Public key encryption, also called asymmetric encryption, uses a one way function / algorithm which enables people to send encrypted messages. This method encrypts the sender’s plain text with the receiver’s public key. The cipher text can therefore only be decrypted using the receiver’s private key, and can not be intercepted by hackers, solving the key distribution problem.</p>

      <h1>Storing passwords securely</h1>
      <p>Hashing and salting algorithms are often used to store passwords securely within confidential databases. Hashing is the process of converting a password into an unidentifiable string using a one way function, meaning it can not be reversed. Salting is the process of adding extra data onto the password before it is hashed which ensures that if two user's choose the same password, they will not recieve the same hash. The hash values of the users can be stored on a secure database and used to check if the users enter the correct password by checking if the password they entered matches one on the database. If a hacker manages to access the password database, they would not be able to determine the actual passwords. Salting further improves the security of the hashing system however can still be breached with a brute force attack in which every possible password is tried until the correct one is found.
      <p>A modern GPU can run a brute force attack at a speed of 292 million hashes per second, meaning it's only a matter of time before you're password is found. In order to speed up this process, the GPU can also use a rainbow table which contains lists of precomputed hashes that enable it to quickly find weak and commonly used passwords. In order to counter the possibility of brute force attacks, passwords can be stored via bcrypt, scrypt or argon2 algorithms which add a cost, increasing the time required for a hack to occur. Even more robust systems can be used to safely store user passwords by using a multilayer protection system which protects your password by a salt, hash and encryption method which would have to be breached one after another for a hacker to access your password. This would cost a lot of time and money and would likely not be worth their while.</p></p>
