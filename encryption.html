      <h1>Encryption</h1>
      <p>Encryption is the process by which data, also known as plaintext, is converted into unreadable ciphertext so that it is protected from potentially being intercepted by hackers. This is achieved through the use of a key which encrypts and decrypts data, preventing it from being intercepted inbetween the sender and the reciever.</p>

      <h1>What is encyption and why is it so important?</h1>
      <p>Encryption is important as it prevents private data from being accessible to hackers, who could potentially use your personal details to blackmail or target you with phishing schemes. Some encryption methods are more breakable than others, such as caesar cipher, but the algorithms used in modern society are typically very sturdy. The public-private key method which is primarily used today is extremely hard to break, but not impossible.</p>
