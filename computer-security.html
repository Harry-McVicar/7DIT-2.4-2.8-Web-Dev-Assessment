      <h1>Computer Security</h1>
      <p>Computer security covers a range of topics from password security to network protection, defining how we are able to maintain secure networks and uphold functionality in spite of the attempted hacking which is often at play. Over the course of this concept you will learn about the choice, usage and storage of passwords, network protection and firewalls, social engineering and user protection as well as the denial of service attacks and hacker profiles.</p>

      <h1>What is computer security and why is it so important?</h1>
      <p>When dealing with computer security, the AIC triad must be considered. This involves the three catagories of availability, integrity and confidentiality which must be delicately balanced in order to ensure the development of a well robust, easy to use sytem.</p>
      <p>Availability refers to maintaining functionality of our digital systems so that our data is available when and where we need it. Integrity identifies the importance of maintaining accurate data which can be neither altered nor deleted by either human error or through malicious attacks. Finally, confidentiality defines the importance that our data remains private and that it is not intercepted while being transmitted across the internet. The way in which these are balanced depends heavily on the level of security required for the sytem as in some cases integrity and confidentiality may be partially sacrificed for better availability or vice versa.</p>
